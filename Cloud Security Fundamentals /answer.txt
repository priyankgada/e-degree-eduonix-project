Setting up a Simple Computing Cluster with LAMP Stack on Azure:
1. Create an Azure Account:
Sign up for an Azure account if you don't have one: Azure Sign Up.
2. Set Up Virtual Machines (VMs):
Create multiple Linux VMs (Ubuntu, for example) on Azure using the Azure Portal.
3. Install LAMP Stack:
Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP on each VM.
Configure necessary settings for each component.
4. Networking:
Configure a Virtual Network (VNet) to connect your VMs securely.
Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
5. Security Infrastructure:
a. SSH Key Authentication:
- Use SSH key pairs for authentication instead of passwords.
- Disable password authentication.

b. Firewall Configuration:
- Set up a firewall on each VM to allow only necessary traffic.
- Allow traffic on specific ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

c. MySQL Security:
- Set strong passwords for MySQL.
- Restrict MySQL access to specific IP addresses.

d. SSL/TLS Configuration:
- Enable SSL/TLS for secure communication.
- Configure Apache to use HTTPS.

e. Regular Updates:
- Keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches.

6. Monitoring and Logging:
Implement Azure Monitor to track the performance of your VMs.
Set up logging to monitor security events.
7. Backup and Recovery:
Regularly backup your databases and server configurations.
Test and document the recovery process.
Document Structure:
Introduction:

Brief overview of the project.
Infrastructure Setup:

Details on VM configuration, networking, and LAMP stack installation.
Security Measures:

Detailed steps for implementing security measures (SSH, Firewall, MySQL, SSL/TLS, Updates).
Monitoring and Logging:

Sharing the Documentation:
You can use a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or any other cloud storage service to host your documentation. Create a Markdown or PDF file and share the link.

Unfortunately, I cannot set up the infrastructure for you or provide external links, but I hope this guidance helps you in setting up and securing your computing cluster on Azure. If you have specific questions about any of the steps, feel free to ask.
