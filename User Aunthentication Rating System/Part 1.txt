User authentication involves verifying the identity of an individual accessing a system, typically by using a combination of factors. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) incorporates at least two of the three authentication factors: something you know (knowledge), something you have (ownership), and something you are (inherence). Here's how a web-based user authentication process could incorporate three different factors:

Knowledge Factor:

Example: Password or PIN
Process:
The user enters their username or email address on the website.
The system prompts the user to enter a password or PIN associated with their account.
This information serves as the "something you know" factor.
Ownership Factor:

Example: One-Time Passcode (OTP) from a mobile app or hardware token
Process:
Upon successful entry of the password or PIN, the system sends a unique one-time passcode to the user's registered mobile device or displays it on a hardware token.
The user enters this one-time passcode as a secondary authentication step.
This information serves as the "something you have" factor.
Inherence Factor:

Example: Biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition)
Process:
After successfully entering the one-time passcode, the system prompts the user to provide a biometric identifier.
The user may need to use a fingerprint scanner, facial recognition via a camera, or another biometric method.
This information serves as the "something you are" factor.
Complete Authentication Process:

Initiation:

User enters username or email address.
User enters a password or PIN (Knowledge factor).
Verification:

System verifies the password or PIN.
If successful, the system generates and sends a one-time passcode to the user's registered device (Ownership factor).
Secondary Authentication:

User enters the received one-time passcode.
If correct, the system prompts the user for biometric authentication (Inherence factor).
Biometric Authentication:

User provides a biometric identifier (e.g., fingerprint, facial scan).
The system compares the provided biometric data with the stored template.
Access Granted:

If all three factors are successfully verified, access to the web application is granted.
If any factor fails, access is denied.
